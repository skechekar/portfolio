# PORTFOLIO PROJECT

## Description 
I created this portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS in order to showcase my projects during my web development journey for both myself and potential clients. This also serves as a way for me to look back on where I have improved and where I could use some variety in my projects. I also have contact links on the page.

## Usage
The deployed portfolio can be accessed via [here](https://skechekar.github.io/portfolio/) hosted on GitHub Pages. Links in the navigation bar will lead you to the correct section when clicked. Hovering over the project images will make the image fade in and trigger the glowing border.
